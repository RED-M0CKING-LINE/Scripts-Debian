# Scripts Debian

These are some of my scripts which I use on my personal Debian-based systems which I would like to share.

There are more scripts that may be shared more privatly.



# LICENSE

I just picked the GPL license to apply to these scripts. I may change the license later on.

Most of these are written by myself, but some may have been sourced from elsewhere.
These exceptions are denoted in the script itself.
